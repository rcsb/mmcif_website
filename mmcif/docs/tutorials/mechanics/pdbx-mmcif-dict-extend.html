<h3>
Types of Extensions
</h3>
<p>
In order of increasing complexity, common types of dictionary extensions
can be classified as the:
</p>


<UL>
<li>
addition of a data item which adds a new property to an existing category.

<li>
addition of a new category with no data items in common with any existing category.

<li>
addition of a new category with some data items in common with an existing category.


<li>
addition of a data item to an existing category which changes the 
composition of the category key.


</UL>

<p>
The following sections provide examples of how one might approach each 
of these extensions.
</p>

<h3>Adding a new property to an existing category</h3>

<p>
This is the simplest type of modification in which a new data item definition 
is appended to an existing category.   The first step in adding an item 
to an existing dictionary is to verify that the data item is not already defined 
within that dictionary.   
</p>

<p> 
After determining that the data item represents new content, the next step
is to select an <i>appropriate</i> item name.   In this example, 
the data item is being added to an existing category so that portion
of the item name is fixed.   The remaining portion should be chosen
to conform with the style of other data item names within
the category.  At the moment, the recommended practice is to
prefix local data items with an institutional acronym.  These
acronyms can be registered and reserved with the IUCr, which
maintains the clearinghouse of these reserved prefixes.  
</p>

<p>
Having chosen a data name, then the item definition can be constructed.
In building the definition a description must be crafted and some consideration
should be given to a default value, examples, and any range restrictions.  Check 
the table of know data types in <code>ITEM_TYPE_LIST</code> and 
known units in <code>ITEM_UNITS_LIST</code>  for an appropriate value.
If an appropriate value cannot be found, then additional entries
in these categories are required in order to create the new data type or 
system of units.   Extending the list of known units also requires
extensions to the table of unit conversions, <code>ITEM_UNITS_CONVERSION</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here is template for the new item definition.
</p>
<pre>
save__existing_category.acronym_new_item_name
    _item_description.description
;              Description goes here ... 
;
    _item.name                  '_existing_category.acronym_new_item_name'
    _item.category_id             existing_category
    _item.mandatory_code          no
    _item_default.value           ?
     loop_
    _item_examples.case
    _item_examples.detail         ?  ?
     loop_
    _item_range.maximum              
    _item_range.minimum           ?  ?
    _item_type.code               ?
    _item_units.code              ?
     save_
</pre>

<p>
If the new data item can only have a discrete set of values, then 
the data items in the <code>ITEM_RANGE</code> category in the above example
should be replaced by items from the <code>ITEM_ENUMERATION</code> 
category.
</p>

<h3>Adding a new category with no common items</h3>

<p>
All of the considerations associated with adding a new data item
apply to the addition of a new category.  In this case, multiple new data items
will be created, and an important consideration here is determining the 
key items for the new category.    We restrict this example
to the case where all of the data items in the category are 
newly created so that there are no interactions with existing
categories.
</p>

<p>
The choice of the data items which compose the unique identifier for
each row of the category is crucial.  In most cases this should be 
a straightforward decision.  However, when the choice is not clear
it may indicate that multiple categories are required to properly
represent the collection of data items.
</p>

<p>
Once the category key has been selected, an appropriate set 
of category and data item names must be chosen.  In this 
case, the category name can carry the institutional 
prefix that will identify the category and its associated
data items as locally developed.    
</p>
<p>
In building the category definition, a description must be created and some 
examples of the full category should be developed.   Some consideration
should also be given to the membership of the new category in an existing 
category group.
</p>
<p>
Here is template for the new category definition.
</p>

<pre>
save_ACRONYM_NEW_CATEGORY
    _category.description
;              Description goes here ... 
;
    _category.id                  acronym_new_category
    _category.mandatory_code      no
     loop_
    _category_key.name          '_acronym_new_category.key_item_1'

     loop_
    _category_group.id           'inclusive_group'
                                 ?
     loop_
    _category_examples.detail    
    _category_examples.case      ?   ?

     save_
</pre>

<p> 
A new category may contain subsets of items which have relationships
which can be described in categories <code>ITEM_RELATED</code>  and 
<code>ITEM_DEPENDENT</code>.   Data items from these categories
should be added to item definitions as required.
</p>

<h3>Adding a new category with some common items</h3>

<p>
The additional complexity in sharing items in a new category with those
of an existing category arises from the new parent-child relationships
that are introduced in such an extension.    It is generally possible to localize
these additional relationships within the definition of the common items in the new
category.   Here is an example of a new category which includes a reference
to the entity identifier which is  has a parent definition in the existing
<code>ENTITY</code> category.    
</p>

<pre>
save__acroynm_new_category.entity_id
    _item_description.description
;              This data item is a pointer to item _entity.id defined in 
               the ENTITY category.
;
    _item.name                  '_acroynm_new_category.entity_id'
    _item.category_id             acronym_new_category
    _item.mandatory_code          yes
    _item_linked.parent_name    '_entity.id'
    _item_linked.child_name     '_acroynm_new_category.entity_id'
     save_
</pre>



<h3>Adding a data item which changes the composition the key in an existing category</h3>
<p>
Changing the composition of an existing category key can profoundly
change the underlying organization of the dictionary.   Such a change
should be considered as a last resort and only after careful consideration 
by the community of dictionary users.
