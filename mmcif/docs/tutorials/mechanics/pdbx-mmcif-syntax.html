<p>  
The syntax used in mmCIF data files and dictionaries is derived
from the STAR (Self-defining Text Archive and Retrieval) grammar. 
In its simplest form, an mmCIF file looks like a paired collection of 
data item names and values.  In the following example of assigning values to cell 
constants, for instance, the interpretation of the syntax is straightforward.
</p>

<pre>
# 
_cell.entry_id           4HHB 
_cell.length_a           63.150 
_cell.length_b           83.590 
_cell.length_c           53.800 
_cell.angle_alpha        90.00 
_cell.angle_beta         99.34 
_cell.angle_gamma        90.00 
_cell.Z_PDB              4 
</pre>

<p>
mmCIF data item names are identified by the leading underscore character.
The underscore is followed by a text string which is interpreted in mmCIF 
as containing both a category name and a keyword name separated by a 
period.  The keyword portion of the name is the unique identifier of the 
data item within the category.  In the example above, all of the data items 
belong to the <code>CELL</code> category.   
The above example also illustrates the one-to-one correspondence required between 
item names and item values.   Data category and data item names are not case sensitive.
</p>

<p>
The next example illustrates the how text strings are expressed in mmCIF.
Short text strings may be enclosed in single or double quotation marks.
Text strings which span multiple lines are enclosed by semi-colons that are placed
at the first character position of the line. 
There are two special characters
used as placeholders for mmCIF item values which for some reason cannot be 
explicitly assigned.
The question mark (<code>?</code>) is used to mark an item value as missing.
A period (<code>.</code>) may be used to identify that there is no 
appropriate value for the item or that a value has been intentionally omitted.

<p>
Vectors and tables of data may be encoded in mmCIF using a 
loop_ directive.   To build a table, the data item names
corresponding to the table columns are preceded by the 
<code>loop_</code> directive, and followed by the corresponding rows of data.
The following example builds a table of author names.  
</p>


<pre>

_citation_author.name

<p>
The use of the <code>loop_</code> directive in mmCIF has a few restrictions.
First, it is required that all of the data items within the loop
belong to the same mmCIF category.  Second, the number of data values
following the loop must be an exact multiple of the number of 
data item names.  Finally,  mmCIF prohibits the nesting of 
<code>loop_</code>  directives.  
</p>

<p>
mmCIF uses data blocks to organize related information and data.  A data
block is a logical partition of a data file  or dictionary created
using a <code>data_</code> directive.  A data block may be named by 
appending a text string after the <code>data_</code> directive and 
a data block is terminated by either another <code>data_</code> directive
or by the end of the file.  The following example shows a very simple 
example of a pair of abbreviated data blocks.

<p>
The above example illustrates how data blocks can be used to 
separate similar information pertaining to different structures.
This separation is required because the mmCIF syntax prohibits 
the repetition of the same category at multiple places within 
the same data block.  As a result, the simple concatenation of the 
contents of the above two data blocks into a single data
block would be syntactically incorrect.  
</p>

<p>
Merging the data blocks in the above example 
raises some additional issues associated with the 
mmCIF data model and the structure of these specific categories.
In above example, it would be possible to merge
the information in the <code>EXPTL_CRYSTAL</code> category
into a single data block by reorganizing this category
using a <code>loop_</code> directive.  However,
certain mmCIF categories like <code>CELL</code> and 
<code>ENTRY</code> may contain only a single value within 
the data block and therefore cannot be looped.
The single-valued property of the data items in these
categories is a consequence of the definition of the key items in these two 
categories.  The category key for the <code>CELL</code> category, 
<code>_cell.entry_id</code>, is a defined as a child definition of
<code>_entry.id</code>.  This item is defined as the data block
identifier and may therefore assume only a single value.
</p>

<p>
Definitions in the mmCIF dictionary are encapsulated in named save frames.   
A save frame begins with the  
<code>save_</code> directive and is terminated by another <code>save_</code> 
directive.  Save frames are named by appending a text string
to the <code>save_</code> token.  In mmCIF dictionaries,
save frames are used to encapsulate item and category definitions.  
The mmCIF dictionary is composed of a data block containing thousands
of save frames, where each save frame contains a different definition.
Save frames may only appear in mmCIF dictionaries and they may not be nested.
The following example shows the save frame containing the definition
of the data item <code>_exptl.details</code>.
</p>

<pre>
save__exptl.details
    _item_description.description
;              Any special information about the experimental work prior to the
               intensity measurement. See also _exptl_crystal.preparation.
;
    _item.name                  '_exptl.details'
    _item.category_id             exptl
    _item.mandatory_code          no
    _item_aliases.alias_name    '_exptl_special_details'
    _item_aliases.dictionary      cif_core.dic
    _item_aliases.version         2.0.1
    _item_type.code               text
     save_
</pre>


<p>
Save frames play a much more important role in STAR than in mmCIF.  In a 
STAR file application such as NMR-STAR where a save frame acts as a reuseable 
cell of information which can be referenced and expanded within the file.  
Save frames are referenced in a STAR file by preceding the save frame name 
with a dollar sign.  The use of save frames in mmCIF has been limited to the organization and scoping
features that they provide.  mmCIF does not support references to save frames
or the use of save frames for purposes other than for encapsulating
dictionary definitions.
