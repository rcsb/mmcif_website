    <DT>attribute
    <DD>
    A column or field in a table.  The term attribute is often used
    as a synonym for an mmCIF data item name.

    <DT>category
    <DD>
    Collections of related data items are organized in mmCIF categories.
    A category is a tabular data structure.  Within a category, those data 
    items that determine the uniqueness of each row in the category/table
    are designated as key data items of the category.

    <DT>category group
    <DD>
    A category group is a named collection of categories.  Categories groups 
    are typically used to organize groups of related categories. For instance, all 
    of the mmCIF categories containing bibliographic information are members of 
    CITATION_GROUP category group.

    <DT>data block
    <DD>
    A data block is an element of STAR grammar.  A data block begins with the token 
    data_ and is terminated by another data_ token
    or the end of file.  Data blocks are named by appending a text string
    to the data_ token.  In mmCIF data files and dictionaries
    data blocks are used as named logical partitions.  Each data block within
    a file is logically independent and defines an independent scope. 
    Data blocks may not be nested within mmCIF files.  

    <DT>data item
    <DD>
    Item and item name refer to the name of an individual element of data.  
    For instance, _atom_site.Cartn_X refers to the x Cartesian
    coordinate.  mmCIF item names all begin with an underscore character.
    This is a convention of the STAR grammar.  The remainder of the item
    consists of a category name and an item keyword separated by a period.  
    The mmCIF item keyword is the unique identifier for the item within 
    its category (mmCIF synonyms:  item, item name, and data item name).

    <DT>data file
    <DD>
    Although mmCIF uses a uniform syntax based on STAR for expressing files 
    containing dictionaries and data, there are some differences in these
    files which require distinction.   The term data file is 
    reserved for files which contain only collections of data items and
    values.  On the hand, mmCIF dictionaries contain primarily definitions 
    encoded in save frames.  Save frames may appear only in mmCIF dictionaries.

    <DT>data type
    <DD>
    mmCIF uses regular expressions to define the patterns which must be
    matched by each data value.  The mmCIF dictionary contains a list
    of the regular expressions describing each data type in the category
    ITEM_TYPE_LIST.  Each mmCIF definition contains a reference
    to one of these regular expressions.

    <DT>DDL
    <DD>
    DDL is an acronym for Dictionary Definition Language.  The role of 
    DDL is to define the components (data items) from which definitions
    may be constructed.   DDL2  provides the framework on which
    the mmCIF dictionary is based.  

    <DT>domain
    <DD>
    The pool of legal values that may be assigned to a data item.

    <DT>enumeration
    <DD>
    A list of allowed values.  An mmCIF definition may include the
    list of discrete values that are permitted for a particular data item.
    For example,  the mmCIF definition for the method used to produce a chemical 
    entity (_entity.src_method) can have three values:  
    <i>man</i> for a genetically manipulated source,  <i>nat</i> for 
    a material from a natural source, <i>syn</i> for synthetic source.

    <DT>item value
    <DD>
    The value assigned to an mmCIF data item.  The simplest form of the
    STAR grammar consists of pairs of data items and data values.

    <DT>key or key item
    <DD>
    The unique identifier for each row in an mmCIF category.

    <DT>loop
    <DD>
    A loop is an element of the STAR grammar.  In order to encode a
    vector or table of data, an individual data item or a group
    of data items within the same category may be preceded by 
    a loop_ token.  The list of data item names
    can then be followed by repeated rows of data values.  The
    number of data values must be an exact multiple of the 
    number of data items.  CIF and mmCIF do not permit the nesting
    of loops.  The following example builds a small table of atomic positions.  

    <pre>
    loop_
      _atom_site.type_symbol
      _atom_site.Cartn_x
      _atom_site.Cartn_y
      _atom_site.Cartn_z
      _atom_site.id
     N  25.369  30.691  11.795  1
     C  25.970  31.965  12.332  2
     C  25.569  32.010  13.808  3
     O  24.735  31.190  14.167  4
    </pre>

    <DT>mandatory data item
    <DD>    
    A mandatory data item must appear in any instance of the category 
    to which the item belongs. Data items which are category keys are 
    always mandatory data items.  Other items may be defined as mandatory
    when their presence is required for each row of the category
    to have a meaningful interpretation.  For instance,  in the 
    ATOM_SITE category,  the item _atom_site.type_symbol
    is a reference to the elemental symbol, and is defined as mandatory.

    <DT>parent-child relationship
    <DD>
    A data item which occurs in multiple categories creates a parent-child 
    relationship.   In the mmCIF dictionary this most commonly occurs for
    for labels and identifiers which are reused throughout the dictionary. 
    For instance, the entity identifier _entity.id defined
    in category ENTITY is the parent definition of this 
    item.  This identifier is reused in the ATOM_SITE category
    as item _atom_site.label_entity_id.  In this case, the data 
    item in the ATOM_SITE category is defined as a child
    of the data item in the ENTITY category.


    <DT>relation
    <DD>
    A table is an informal equivalent of a relation.  It is similarly
    equivalent to an mmCIF category.  

    <DT>regular expression
    <DD>
    Regular sets and expressions derive from a very formal decomposition of 
    language structure.  In the mmCIF dictionary, a regular expression notation
    is used to define the patterns which must be matched by values of a data
    item.  For instance,  a calendar date in the mmCIF dictionary must match
    a pattern like yyyy-mm-dd, which can be defined by the regular expression
    [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9].

    <DT>save frame
    <DD>
    A save frame is a STAR syntax element.    
    A save frame begins with the token 
    save_ and is terminated by another save_ token.
    Save frames are named by appending a text string
    to the save_ token.  In mmCIF dictionaries
    save frames are used to encapsulate item and category definitions.  
    The mmCIF dictionary is composed of a data block containing thousands
    of save frames, where each save frame contains a different definition.
    Save frames may only appear in mmCIF dictionaries and may not be nested.

    <DT>scope
    <DD>
    A scope delimits logically independent sections.  The scope delimiters
    in the STAR grammar are data blocks and the save frames.  Multiple 
    data blocks may occur within a single file, but the 
    definitions and declarations in different data blocks are logically
    independent.   Similarly, save frames delimit sections of independent
    scope within a data block.   The mmCIF dictionary is organized as 
    a collection of save frames within a single data block.  Each save
    frame holds a different definition, and this set of 
    related definitions is arranged in a single data block.

    <DT>STAR
    <DD>
    STAR is the acronym for Self-Defining Text Archive and Retrieval.  The
    syntax used by CIF and mmCIF is derived from the STAR grammar.  

    <DT>subcategory
    <DD>
    A subcategory is a named collection of data items within a 
    category.  Subcategories are used to indicate a special subsets
    of data items.  For instance, the data items _atom_site.Cartn_x,
    _atom_site.Cartn_y, and _atom_site.Cartn_z 
    belong to a subcategory named cartesian_coordinate.

    <DT>table
    <DD>
    A table is data structure composed of columns and rows.  mmCIF categories
    are table-like structures in which the data items form the columns and 
    with the data values occupying the rows.  

    <DT>tuple
    <DD>
    A tuple is informally equivalent to a row in a table or a row in an mmCIF category.
