<h3>mmCIF Early History</h3>
<p>
'CIF' is an acronym for the Crystallographic Information File.  CIF is a
subset of STAR (Self-defining Text Archive and Retrieval format <a
href="early-history.html#1">[1]</a>). The CIF format is suitable for archiving, in any
order, all types of text and numerical data. The goals of CIF are to explore
its generality, upward compatibility, flexibility, and to incorporate these in
electronic publication.  </p>
<p>
CIF was developed by the IUCr Working Party on Crystallographic Information in
an effort sponsored by the IUCr Commission on Crystallographic Data and the
IUCr Commission on Journals. The result of this effort was a
dictionary of data items sufficient for archiving the small molecule
crystallographic experiment and its results <a
href="early-history.html#2">[2]</a>. This dictionary was adopted by the IUCr at its
1990 Congress in Bordeaux. CIF is now the format in which structure papers are
submitted to <i>Acta Crystallographica C</i>; software has been developed to
automatically typeset a paper from a CIF.  </p>

<p>
In 1990, the IUCr formed a working group that would expand this dictionary
by including data items relevant to the macromolecular crystallographic
experiment. This working group was chaired by Paula Fitzgerald and
included Enrique Abola, Helen Berman, Phil
Bourne, Eleanor Dodson, Art Olson, Wolfgang
Steigemann, Lynn Ten Eyck, and Keith Watenpaugh
(Upjohn).</p>

<p>
The original short term goal of the working group was to fulfill the mandate
set by the IUCr: to define mmCIF data names that needed to be included in the
CIF dictionary in order to adequately describe the macromolecular
crystallographic experiment and its results. Long term goals were also
determined: to provide sufficient data names so that the experimental
section of a structure paper could be written automatically and to
facilitate the development of tools so that computer programs could easily
interface with the CIF.</p>

<p>
In order to describe the progress of this project and to solicit community
feedback, several informal and formal meetings were held. The first meeting,
hosted by Eleanor Dodson, convened in April 1993 at the University of York.
The attendees included the mmCIF working group, structural biologists and
computer scientists. A major focus of the discussion was whether the formal
structure of the dictionary that was implemented using the then-current Dictionary Definition
Language (DDL 1.0) was adequate to deal with the complexity of the
macromolecular data items. Criticisms included the idea that the data typing was
not strong enough and that there were no formal links among the data items.
A working group was formed to try to address these issues. The second
Workshop was hosted by Phil Bourne in Tarrytown, NY in October 1993. The
topics at that meeting focused on the development of software tools and the
requirements of an enhanced DDL. In October 1994, a workshop hosted by Shoshana Wodak at the Free
University of Brussels, resulted in the development of a new DDL that
addressed the various problems that had been identified at the previous workshops. The dictionary was
cast in this new DDL 2 and was presented at the ACA meeting in Montreal in
July 1995.</p>

<p>
This dictionary was open for further community review. The dictionary was
placed on a World Wide Web site and community comments were solicited via a
list server. Lively discussions via this mmCIF list server ensued, resulting
in the continuous correction and updating of the dictionary. Software was
developed and was also presented on an early mmCIF Resource web site.
The tools that were available at this point in time included:
CIFtbx2 (Extended CIF Tool Box; Fortran), OOSTAR (applications to manipulate STAR files;
Objective-C), pdb2cif (awk script to convert PDB to mmCIF), and
CIFLIB (C Language Application Program Interface).</p>

<p>
In January 1997, the mmCIF dictionary was completed and submitted to
COMCIFS for review, and version 1.0 was released in June 1997<a
href="early-history.html#3">[3</a>,<a href="early-history.html#4">4]</a>. A workshop
held at Rutgers University in October 1997 was hosted by Helen
Berman. Tutorials were presented to demonstrate the use of the various
tools that had been developed. Discussion about how to proceed with
the maintenance and evolution of the dictionary led to a plan for
extending the dictionary using template definitions.  Versions of the
mmCIF dictionary that followed included new definitions that were reviewed
according to this plan.

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>

The development of the mmCIF dictionary and the associated DDL 2.2.1 was
an enormous task, and any list of contributors to the effort will
certainly be incomplete.  Many people that have taken the time to think
carefully and constructively about all of this. To begin it is important to recognize
Syd Hall, David Brown and Frank Allen, who began the entire CIF effort and
who recruited us to do the extensions for macromolecular structure.</p><p>

The above history lists the people who were members of the original working
party, but the number of people who contributed to the original design of
the mmCIF data structure is in fact much larger and includes contributions
from Steve Bryant, Vivian Stojanoff, Jean Richelle, Eldon
Ulrich, and Brian Toby.</p><p>

There are also the people who realized the shortcomings of the original DDL,
and worked hard to convince us that a more rigorous underpinning for the
dictionary would been needed. Among them are Michael Scharf, Peter Gray,
Peter Murray-Rust, Dave Stampf, and Jan Zelinka.</p><p>

Writing the dictionary and developing the new DDL were just the starting
points for evaluation and critique, and this effort has been greatly aided
by the input from COMCIFS, the IUCr committee with oversight over this
process (Brian McMahon, Coordinating Secretary). But the real process of
review, after the dictionary was released to the public for comment in
August of 1995, has involved a much larger cast. This review received
valuable input from Frances Bernstein,
Herbert Bernstein, Dale Tronrud, and Peter Keller.</p><p>

The dictionary development effort was also enabled by the staff of the Nucleic Acid
Database at Rutgers University, who have dealt with many of the technical
issues of implementation of mmCIF with real data. So we would also like to
thank Anke Gelbin, Shu-Hsin Hsieh, and Christine Zardecki (the author of
this Web page.)</p><p>

Without the three CIF workshops, this effort would never have taken the
shape and focus. The organizers of those workshops include: Eleanor Dodson,
Phil Bourne, Shoshana Wodak and Helen Berman, and with the funding provided
by ESF, EU, NSF, and DOE.
