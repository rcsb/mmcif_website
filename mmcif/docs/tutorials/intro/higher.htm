<h2>
<a name="higher">Higher Level Structure</a>
</h2>

Higher level structural description in mmCIF is contained in the 
<code>STRUCT</code> category group.  The top level description of the 
structure within an mmCIF data file is contained in the 
<code>STRUCT</code> category.  The textual description of the structure
may include both a title and keywords.  This description is labeled 
with the top level identifier in an mmCIF data block, the <code>_entry.id</code>.

<p>
The crystallographic asymmetric unit
is described in the <code>STRUCT_ASYM</code> category.   This category
lists the entities that were observed in the asymmetric unit and introduces
an identifier (<code>_struct_asym.id</code>) for each.   This identifier
forms a part of the atom label in the <code>ATOM_SITE</code> category,
and this is used as an identifier in generating biological assemblies.  

<p>
Biologically important assemblies are described in the collection of categories 
descending from <code>STRUCT_BIOL</code>.  Each biological assembly
is identified in the <code>STRUCT_BIOL</code> category and generated
from components of the asymmetric unit using crystallograhic symmetry 
operations.  Each assembly may by described by a keyword list and may 
be presented in a number of different views.     

<p>
The relationships between these categories in the <code>STRUCT</code> group 
are shown in the following diagram.

In the following example for HIV protease (PDB 5HVP, Fitzgerald <i>et al.</i>, 1990) there
are two entities:  the monomeric form of the enzyme  and the drug inhibitor.  
The asymmetric unit contains two copies of each entity.  Three biological 
assemblies are constructed for this system.  One biological form contains
the dimeric form of the enzyme and two others contain the dimeric 
enzyme plus one copy of the inhibitor.

  Hence this biological unit (2) is roughly twofold symmetric to biological
  unit (3). Disorder in the protein chain indicated with alternative
  id 1 should be used with this biological unit.

In the following example for the drug-DNA complex (NDB DDF040, Leonard <i>et al.</i>, 1993)
there are three entities in the asymmetric unit:  one strand of DNA, drug and solvent.
The biological assembly in this example is generated from the contents asymmetric unit and
a second copy of the asymmetric unit transformed by the 8th symmetry operation of this space group.
