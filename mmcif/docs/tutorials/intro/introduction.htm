This tutorial provides a tour of the some of the category groups 
in the mmCIF dictionary which describe macromolecular structure.  Some
of the dictionary terminology used to describe elements 
of molecular structure are also described.    Each group of 
categories is presented in the form of a schematic diagram and 
a set of abbreviated examples.   Category diagrams are provided for 
each example.

<p>
The category diagrams are organized in the following manner:

<ul>
<li>

<li>
