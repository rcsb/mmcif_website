<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Protein Data Bank (PDB) format provides a standard representation
for macromolecular structure data derived from X-ray diffraction and NMR
studies. This representation has served the community well since its inception
in the 1970's (Bernstein <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>)
and a large amount of software that uses this representation has been written.
However, it is widely recognized that the current PDB format cannot express
adequately the large amount of data (content) associated with a single
macromolecular structure and the experiment from which it was derived in
a way (context) that is consistent and permits direct comparison with other
structure entries. Structure comparison, for such purposes as better understanding
biological function, assisting in the solution of new structures, drug
design, and structure prediction, becomes increasingly valuable as the
number of macromolecular structures continues to grow at a near exponential
rate. It could be argued that the description of the required content of
a structure submission could be met by additional PDB record types. However,
this format does not permit the maintenance of the <i>automated</i> level
of consistency, accuracy, and reproducibility required for such a large
body of data. </p>

<p>A variety of approaches for improved scientific data representation
is being explored (IEEE<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>). The approach
described here, which has been developed under the auspices of the International
Union of Crystallography (IUCr), is to extend the Crystallographic Information
File (CIF) data representation used for describing small molecule structures
and associated diffraction experiments. This extension is referred to as
the macromolecular Crystallographic Information File (mmCIF) and is the
subject of this paper. The paper briefly covers the history of mmCIF, similarities
to and differences from the PDB format, contents of the mmCIF dictionary,
and how to represent structures using mmCIF. The mmCIF home page (mmCIF<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>)
contains a historic description of the development of the dictionary, current
versions of the dictionary in text and HTML formats, software tools, archives
of the mmCIF discussion list, and a detailed on-line tutorial (Bourne<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>).
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>CIF was developed to describe small molecule organic structures and
the crystallographic experiment by the International Union of Crystallography
(IUCr) Working Party on Crystallographic Information at the behest of the
IUCr Commission on Crystallographic Data and the IUCr Commission on Journals.
The result of this effort was a core dictionary of data items sufficient
for archiving the small molecule crystallographic experiment and its results
(Hall <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>, IUCr<sup>6</sup>).
This core dictionary was adopted by the IUCr at its 1990 Congress in Bordeaux.
The format of the small molecule CIF dictionary and the data files based
upon that dictionary conform to a restricted version of the Self Defining
Text Archive and Retrieval (STAR) representation developed by Hall (Cook
and Hall<sup>7</sup>, Hall and Spadaccini<sup>8</sup>). STAR permits a
data organization that may be understood by analogy with a spoken language
(Fig. 1). </p>

<p><b>Figure 1 </b>Components of the STAR/CIF data representation and their
analogy to a natural language. </p>

<p>STAR defines a set of encoding rules similar to saying the English language
is comprised of 26 letters. A Dictionary Definition Language (DDL) is defined
which uses those rules and which provides a framework from which to define
a dictionary of the terms needed by the discipline. Think of the DDL as
a computer readable way of declaring that words are made up of arbitrary
groups of letters and that words are organized into sentences and paragraphs.
The DDL provides a convention for naming and defining data items within
the dictionary, declaring specific attributes of those data items, for
example, a range of values and the data type, and for declaring relationships
between data items. In other words, the DDL defines the format of the dictionary
and any new words that are added must conform to that format. Just as words
are constantly being added to a language, data items will be added to the
dictionaries as the discipline evolves. The STAR encoding rules and the
DDL are being used to develop a variety of dictionaries and reference files,
for example, the powder diffraction dictionary, the modulated structures
dictionary, a file of ideal geometry for amino acids, and an NMR dictionary.
This extensibility is attractive since the same basic reading and browsing
software (context-based tools) can be used irrespective of the data content.
Data files (this paper is an example in our language analogy) are composed
of data items found in the dictionaries. </p>

<p>In 1990, the IUCr formed a working group to expand the core dictionary
to include data items relevant to the macromolecular crystallographic experiment.
Version 1.0 of the mmCIF dictionary (Fitzgerald <i>et al</i><sup>.<font size="-2"><a href="#ref9">9</a></font>,</sup>
mmCIF<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>), which encompasses many data items
from the current core dictionary (IUCr<sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>),
is in the final stage of review by COMCIFs, the IUCr appointed committee
overseeing CIF developments. This dictionary has been written using DDL
v2.1.1 (Westbrook and Hall<sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>), which is
significantly enhanced, yet upwardly compatible with DDL v1.4 (IUCr<sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>)
currently used for the small molecule dictionary. </p>

<h3>Considerations in the Development the mmCIF Dictionary</h3>

<p>In developing version 1.0 of the mmCIF dictionary we made the following
decisions. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<ul>
<li>Every field of every PDB record type should be represented by a data
item if that PDB field is important for describing the structure, the experiment
that was conducted in determining the structure or the revision history
of the entry. It is important to note that it is straightforward to convert
a mmCIF data file to a PDB file without loss of information since all information
is parsable. It is not possible, however, to automate completely the conversion
of a PDB file to a mmCIF, since many mmCIF data items either are not present
in the PDB file or are present in PDB REMARK records that in some instances
cannot be parsed. The content of PDB REMARK records are maintained as separate
data items within mmCIF so as to preserve all information, even if that
information is not parsable.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Data items should be defined such that all the information described
in the materials and methods section of a structure paper could be referenced.
This includes major features of the crystal, the diffraction experiment,
phasing methodology, and refinement.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Data items should be defined such that the biologically active molecule
could be described as well as any structural sub-components deemed important
by the crystallographer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Atomic coordinates should be representable as either orthogonal Ångstrom
or fractional.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Data items should be provided to describe final h,k,l's including those
collected at different wavelengths.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>For the most part data items specific to an NMR experiment or modeling
study would not be included in version 1.0. Exceptions are the data items
that summarize the features of an ensemble of structures and permit the
description of each member of the ensemble.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry should be defined.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A comprehensive set of data items for providing a higher order structure
description, for example, to cover supersecondary structure and functional
classification, was considered beyond the scope of version 1.0.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Data items should be present for describing the characteristics and
geometry of canonical and non-canonical amino acids, nucleotides, and heterogen
groups.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Data items should be present that permit a detailed description of
the chemistry of the component parts of the macromolecule, including the
provision for 2-D projections.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Data items should be present that provide specific pointers from elements
of the structure (e.g., the sequence, bound inhibitors) to the appropriate
entries in publicly available databases.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Data items should be present that provide meaningful 3-D views of the
structure so as to highlight functional and structural aspects of the macromolecule.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the above, a mmCIF dictionary with approximately 1500 data
items (including those data items taken from the small molecule dictionary)
was developed. It is not expected that all relevant data items will be
present in each mmCIF data file. What data items are mandatory to describe
the structure and experiment adequately needs to be decided by community
consensus. </p>

<h3>Comparing a mmCIF Data File with a PDB File</h3>

<p>The format of a mmCIF containing structural data can best be introduced
through analogy with the existing PDB format. A PDB file consists of a
series of records each identified by a keyword (e.g., HEADER, COMPND) of
up to 6 characters. The format and content of fields within a record are
dependent on the keyword. A mmCIF, on the other hand, always consists of
a series of <i>name-value</i> pairs (a data item) defined by STAR, where
the data name is preceded by a leading underscore (_) to distinguish it
from the data value. Thus, every field in a PDB record is represented in
mmCIF by a specific data name. The PDB HEADER record, </p>

<p><tt>HEADER PLANT SEED PROTEIN 11-OCT-91
1CBN</tt> </p>

<p>becomes: </p>

<p><tt>_struct.entry_id '1CBN'</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_struct.title 'PLANT SEED PROTEIN'</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_struct_keywords.entry_id '1CBN'</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_struct_keywords.text 'plant
seed protein'</tt> </p>

<p><tt>_database_2.database_id 'PDB'</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_database_2.database_code '1CBN'</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_database_PDB_rev.rev_num 1</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_database_PDB_rev.date_original
'1991-10-11'</tt> </p>

<p>The <i>name</i>-<i>value</i> pairing represents a major departure from
the PDB file format and has the advantage of providing an explicit reference
to each item of data within the data file, rather than having the interpretation
left to the software reading the file. The <i>name</i> matches an entry
in the mmCIF dictionary where characteristics of that data item are explicitly
defined. Where multiple values for the same data item exist, the name of
the data item or items concerned is declared in a header and the associated
values follow in strict rotation. This is a STAR rule referred to as a
<i>loop_</i> construct. This <i>loop_</i> construct is illustrated in the
representation of atomic coordinates. </p>

<p><tt>loop_</tt> </p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.group_PDB</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.type_symbol</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.label_atom_id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.label_comp_id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.label_asym_id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.label_seq_id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.label_alt_id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.cartn_x</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.cartn_y</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.cartn_z</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.occupancy</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.B_iso_or_equiv</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.footnote_id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.auth_seq_id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_atom_site.id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>ATOM N N VAL A 11 . 25.369 30.691
11.795 1.00 17.93 . 11 1</tt> </p>

<p><tt>ATOM C CA VAL A 11 . 25.970 31.965
12.332 1.00 17.75 . 11 2</tt> </p>

<p><tt>ATOM C C VAL A 11 . 25.569 32.010
13.881 1.00 17.83 . 11 3</tt> </p>

<p><tt># <i>[data omitted]</i></tt>
</p>

<p>Note that the <i>name</i> construct is of the form <i>_category.extension</i>.
The category explicitly defines a natural grouping of data items such that
all data items of a single category are contained within a single <i>loop_</i>.
There is no restriction on the length of <i>name</i>, beyond the record
length limit of 80 characters mentioned below, and while there is no formal
syntax within <i>name</i> beyond the category and extension separated by
a period, by convention the category and extension are represented as an
informal hierarchy of parts, with each part separated by an underscore
(_). The components of <i>_atom_site.label<font size="-1"> </font></i>are
examples. </p>

<p>Questions that arise concerning the separation of data names and data
values are solved with some additional syntax. For example, what if the
data value contains white space, an underscore, or runs over several lines?
Similarly, what if a value in a <i>loop_</i> is undefined or has no meaning
in the context in which it is defined? The following syntax rules, which
are a more restricted set of rules than permitted by STAR, complete the
mmCIF description. </p>

<p>Comments are preceded by a hash (#) and terminated by a new line. </p>

<p>Data values on a single line may be delimited by pairs of single (')
or double (&quot;) quotes. </p>

<p>Data values that extend beyond a single line are enclosed within semicolons
(;) as the first character of the line that begins the text block and the
first character of the line following the last line of text. </p>

<p>Data values which are unknown are represented by a question mark (?).
</p>

<p>Data values which are undefined are represented by a period (.). </p>

<p>The length of a record in mmCIF is restricted to 80 characters. </p>

<p>Only printable ASCII characters are permitted. </p>

<p>Only a single level of <i>loop_</i> is permissible. </p>

<p>To complete the introductory picture of the appearance of a mmCIF data
file consider the notion of scope. A PDB file has essentially one form
of scope - the complete file. Thus, a single structure or an ensemble of
structures is represented by a single file with each member of the ensemble
separated by a PDB MODEL keyword record. There is no computer readable
mechanism for associating components of say the REMARK records with a particular
member of the ensemble. The mmCIF representation deals with this issue
by using the STAR data block concept. Data blocks begin with <i>data_ </i>and
have a scope that extends until the next <i>data_</i> or an end-of-file
is reached. A <i>name</i> may appear only once in a data block, but data
items may appear in any order. A consequence of these STAR rules is that
the combination of data block name and data name is always unique. </p>

<h3>Contents of the mmCIF Dictionary</h3>

<p><a href="#table1">Table I </a>summarizes the category groups, their
associated individual categories and their definitions as found in the
mmCIF dictionary version 0.8.02 dated March 18, 1996. This comprehensive
hierarchy of categories follows closely the progress of the experiment
and the subsequent structure description. </p>

<h3>Structure Representation Using mmCIF</h3>

<p>The categories describing the crystallographic experiment are relatively
self explanatory and will not be detailed here. We will, however, outline
the data model used to describe the resulting structure and its description.
</p>

<p>The structural data model can most simply be described as containing
three interrelated groups of categories: <i>ATOM_SITE</i> categories that
give coordinates and related information of the structure; <i>ENTITY</i>
categories, which describe the chemistry of the components of the structure,
and <i>STRUCT</i> categories, which analyze and describe the structure.
</p>

<p>The data items in the <i>ATOM_SITE</i> category record details about
the atom sites including the coordinates, the thermal displacement parameters,
the errors in the parameters and include a specification of the component
of the asymmetric unit to which an atom belongs. </p>

<p>The <i>ENTITY</i> category categorizes the unique chemical components
of the asymmetric unit as to whether they are polymer, non-polymer or water.
The characteristics of a polymer are described by the <i>ENTITY_POLY</i>
category and the sequence of the chemical components comprising the polymer
by the <i>ENTITY_POLY_SEQ</i> category. The <i>CHEM_COMP</i> categories
describe the standard geometries of the monomer units such as the amino
acids and nucleotides as well as that of the ligands and solvent groups.
</p>

<center><p>The <i>STRUCT_BIOL</i> category allows the person to describe
the biologically relevant features of a structure and its component parts.
The <i>STRUCT_BIOL_GEN</i> category provides the information about how
to generate the biological unit from the components of the asymmetric unit
which are in turn specified by the <i>STRUCT_ASYM</i> category. Various
features of the structure such as intermolecular hydrogen bonds, special
sites and secondary structure are specified in <i>STRUCT_CONN</i>, <i>STRUCT_SITE</i>
and <i>STRUCT_CONF, </i>respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the interrelationships
among these categories. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <img src="/docs/pubs/fig2ab.gif" height="531" width="446"></p></center>

<ul>
<p><b>Figure 2 a) </b>The relationships between categories which describe
biologically relevant structure. <b>b)</b> The relationships between categories
describing polymer structure, the atomic coordinates, and those categories
which describe structural features such as hydrogen bonding and secondary
structure. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
</ul>

<p>These and other major descriptive features of the mmCIF dictionary are
best explored by example. A browsable dictionary can be found at the mmCIF
WWW site (mmCIF<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>) as well as some complete
examples. Complete examples for all nucleic acids can be found at the Nucleic
Acid Database WWW site (NDB<sup>13</sup>). Partial mmCIFs for every structure
in the PDB are available at two WWW sites (PDB<sup><font size="-2"><a href="#ref14">14</a></font></sup>,
SDSC<sup><font size="-2"><a href="#ref15">15</a></font></sup>) having been
generated with the program <i>pdb2cif</i> (Bernstein <i>et al</i>.<sup><font size="-2"><a href="#ref16">16</a></font></sup>).
</p>

<p><i>Example One</i> </p>

<p>Starting simply, consider the protein crambin which is a single polypeptide
chain of 48 residues and in the low temperature form at 0.83 Å resolution
(Teeter <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>; PDB code 1CBN)
has nearly all the protein bound solvent resolved as well as an ethanol
molecule co-crystallized. The protein shows recognizable sequence micro
heterogeneity at positions 22 (Pro/Ser) and 25 (Leu/Ile) and 24% of residues
show discrete disorder. While these features are described using data items
in the mmCIF dictionary, they are not detailed here for the sake of simplicity.
</p>

<p>Since the biological function of this molecule is unknown, no biologically
relevant structural components are justified. A single identifier (<i>crambin_1</i>)
is used to identify the unknown biological function of this molecule. </p>

<p><tt>_struct_biol.id crambin_1</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_struct_biol.details</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>; The function of this protein
is unknown and therefore the</tt> </p>

<p><tt>biological unit is assumed to
be the single polypeptide</tt> </p>

<p><tt>chain without co-crystallization
factors i.e. ethanol.</tt> </p>

<p><tt>;</tt> </p>

<p>The single biological descriptor, <i>crambin_1</i>, is generated from
the single polypeptide chain found in the asymmetric unit without any symmetry
transformations applied. The polypeptide chain is designated <i>chain_a</i>.
</p>

<p><tt>_struct_biol_gen.biol_id crambin_1</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_struct_biol_gen.asym.id chain_a</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_struct_biol_gen.symmetry 1_555</tt>
</p>

<p>The chemical components of the asymmetric unit are three entities: a
single polypeptide chain characterized as a polymer, ethanol characterized
as non-polymer, and water. Whether the source of the entity is a natural
product, or it has been synthesized is also indicated. </p>

<p><tt>loop_</tt> </p>

<p><tt>_entity.id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity.type</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity.formula_weight</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity.src_method</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>A polymer 4716 'NATURAL'</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>ethanol non-polymer 52 'SYNTHETIC'</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>H20 water 18 .</tt>
</p>

<p>It is then possible to expand upon this basic description of each entity
using the <i>entity.id</i> as a reference. So for example the common and
systematic names are specified as, </p>

<p><tt>_entity_name_com.entity_id A</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity_name_com.name crambin</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity_name_sys.entity_id A</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity_name_sys.name 'Crambe
Abyssinica'</tt> </p>

<p>Similarly, the natural and synthetic description can be given in more
detail, so for the natural product we have, </p>

<p><tt>_entity_src_nat.entity_id A</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity_src_nat.common_name 'Abyssinian
Cabbage'</tt> </p>

<p><tt>_entity_src_nat.genus ?</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity_src_nat.species ?</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_entity_src_nat.details ?</tt>
</p>

<p>Using the entities as building blocks the contents of the asymmetric
unit are specified. Crambin is straightforward since each entity appears
only once in the asymmetric unit. </p>

<p><tt>loop_</tt> </p>

<p><tt>_struct_asym.id</tt>

<p><tt>H20 H20 .</tt>
</p>

<p>Entities classified as polymer, in this instance only that entity identified
as <i>A</i>, is further described. First, the overall features of the polypeptide
chain. </p>

</p>

<p>and then the component parts, </p>

</p>

<p><tt># <i>[data omitted]</i></tt>
</p>

<p><tt>A 47 ALA A 48 ASN</tt>
</p>

<p>The entity may also exist in other databases and these references may
be cited and described. For the entity designated <i>A, </i>which is defined
in Genbank but without sequence microheterogeneity we have, </p>

<p>These intermolecular interactions are partially specified on PDB CONNECT
records. However mmCIF provides an additional level of detail such that
the criteria used to define an interaction may be given using the STRUCT_CONN_TYPE
category. Here is a hypothetical example used to describe a salt bridge
and a hydrogen bond. </p>

<p><i>Example Two</i> </p>

<p>Consider a mmCIF representation for a more complex structure. The gene
regulatory protein 434 CRO complexed with a 20 base pair DNA segment containing
operator (Mondragon and Harrison<sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>; PDB
code 3CRO). </p>

<p><tt>_struct_biol.id</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>_struct_biol.details</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>complex</tt> </p>

<p><tt>; The complex consists of 2 protein
domains bound to a</tt> </p>

<p><tt>20 base pair DNA segment.</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>;</tt> </p>

<p><tt>protein</tt> </p>

<p><tt>; Each of the 2 protein domains
is a single homologous</tt> </p>

<p><tt>polypeptide chain of 71 residues
designated L and R.</tt> </p>

<p><tt>;</tt> </p>

<p><tt>DNA</tt> </p>

<p><tt>; The two strands (A and B) are
complementary given a one</tt> </p>

<p><tt>base offset.</tt>
</p>

<p>; </p>

<p>The protein/DNA complex, the protein, and the DNA are considered as
three separate biological components each generated from the contents of
the asymmetric unit. No crystallographic symmetry need be applied to generate
the biologically relevant components. </p>

<p><tt>water water</tt>
</p>

<p>Since each protein domain is chemically identical they constitute a
single entity which has been designated <i>dimer</i>. The complementary
DNA strands are not chemically identical and therefore constitute two separate
entities: </p>

</p>

<p><tt>B DNA_B '20 base strand'</tt>
</p>

<p><tt>H2O water 'solvent'</tt>
</p>

<p>Features of the CRO 434 secondary structure and intermolecular contacts
can be described in the same way in which crambin was represented and are
not repeated. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In preparing these examples of representing macromolecular structure
using mmCIF it was necessary to return to the original papers since not
all the relevant information could be retrieved from the PDB entry. This
is evidence that mmCIF provides additional information which also has the
advantage of being in a computer readable form. The consequence is that
it places additional emphasis on the person preparing the mmCIF. It is
anticipated that full use of the expressive power of mmCIF will only be
made when existing structure solution and refinement programs are modified
to maintain mmCIF data items and software tools exist to help prepare and
use a mmCIF effectively. A variety of software tools have been developed
for mmCIF (Bernstein, <i>et al</i>.<sup> <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>;
Westbrook, <i>et al</i>. <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>). A description
of a variety of other efforts can be found elsewhere (Bourne<sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>).
Code and documentation is available at the mmCIF WWW site (mmCIF<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>).
A long term goal might be to maintain all aspects of the structure determination
in an electronic laboratory notebook that uses mmCIF as its underlying
data representation. The notebook would have a "journal" button
that would be used at the appropriate time. </p>
